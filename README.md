ipta
====

A smart wrapper for Linux's iptables command

Invokable:
1) With the same arguments as iptables, in case it will pass those on to iptables
2) With its own syntax, in which case it will invoke and parse iptables, possibly multiple times, to gather information to display to the user

Language:
Perl
